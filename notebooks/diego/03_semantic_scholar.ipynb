However, previous methods primarily focus on improving the accuracy of CD, while neglecting the reliability of detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection network, called AR-CDNet, which is able to provide accurate change maps and generate pixel-wise uncertainty. Specifically, an online uncertainty estimation branch is constructed to model the pixel-wise uncertainty, which is supervised by the difference between predicted change maps and corresponding ground truth during the training process. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge review strategy to distill temporal change knowledge from low-level features to high-level ones, thereby enhancing the discriminability of temporal difference features. Finally, we aggregate the uncertainty-aware features extracted from the online uncertainty estimation branch with multi-level temporal difference features to improve the accuracy of CD. Once trained, our AR-CDNet can provide accurate change maps and evaluate pixel-wise uncertainty without ground truth. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AR-CDNet in the CD task. The demo code for our work will be publicly available at \\\\url{https://github.com/guanyuezhen/AR-CDNet}.', 'venue': 'arXiv.org', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 0,

Pair-to-Video Change Detection Networks for Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Images', 'abstract': 'As an important yet challenging task in Earth observation, change detection (CD) is undergoing a technological revolution, given the broadening application of deep learning. Nevertheless, existing deep learning-based CD methods still suffer from two salient issues: 1) incomplete temporal modeling, and 2) space-time coupling. In view of these issues, we propose a more explicit and sophisticated modeling of time and accordingly establish a pair-to-video change detection (P2V-CD) framework. First, a pseudo transition video that carries rich temporal information is constructed from the input image pair, interpreting CD as a problem of video understanding. Then, two decoupled encoders are utilized to spatially and temporally recognize the type of transition, and the encoders are laterally connected for mutual promotion. Furthermore, the deep supervision technique is applied to accelerate the model training. We illustrate experimentally that the P2V-CD method compares favorably to other state-of-the-art CD approaches in terms of both the visual effect and the evaluation metrics, with a moderate model size and relatively lower computational overhead. Extensive feature map visualization experiments demonstrate how our method works beyond making contrasts between bi-temporal images.

Contourlet fusion uses complementary information from different types of difference images. For unchanged regions, the details should be restrained while highlighted for changed regions. Different fusion rules are designed for low frequency band and high frequency directional bands of Contourlet coefficients.

The recent research works dominated by hyperspectral binary change detection, however, cannot provide fine change classes information. And most methods incorporating spectral unmixing for hyperspectral multiclass change detection (HMCD), yet suffer from the neglection of temporal correlation and error accumulation. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change Guided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD, which aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing result with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel partial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral unmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the pseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the unmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the abundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels more accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put forward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to numerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process and the change detection process is proposed to eliminate the accumulated errors and bias from unmixing result to change detection result.

In this way, a specific weights set is estimated while ignoring any uncertainty that may occur in the proper weight space. The latter introduces randomness into the framework, either by assuming a prior distribution over model parameters (i.e. Bayesian Neural Networks) or including latent variables (i.e. generative models) to explore the contribution of latent variables for model predictions, leading to stochastic predictions during testing. Different from the former that achieves point estimation, the latter aims to estimate the prediction distribution, making it possible to estimate uncertainty, representing model ignorance about its predictions. We claim that conventional deterministic neural network based dense prediction tasks are prone to overfitting, leading to over-confident predictions, which is undesirable for decision making. In this paper, we investigate stochastic neural networks and uncertainty estimation techniques to achieve both accurate deterministic prediction and reliable uncertainty estimation. Specifically, we work on two types of uncertainty estimations solutions, namely ensemble based methods and generative model based methods, and explain their pros and cons while using them in fully/semi/weakly-supervised framework. Due to the close connection between uncertainty estimation and model calibration, we also introduce how uncertainty estimation can be used for deep model calibration to achieve well-calibrated models, namely dense model calibration.

With the increase in the spatial resolution of RS images, high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image CD tasks receive growing attention. The change information hidden in multitemporal HRRS images could help discover our planet comprehensively. In the current deep learning era, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become one of the most powerful tools for a wide range of RS tasks including HRRS image CD, due to their superb feature learning capacity. However, most of them need a large amount of labeled data to accomplish the CD process, which is challenging or even impractical in many RS applications. Also, given the limited valid receptive field, CNNs can only capture short-range context within HRRS images, which is probably not enough to fully explore change information from the images. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we propose an unsupervised CD method, termed GMCD, based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and metric learning. GMCD consists of a Siamese fully convolution network (FCN), a multiscale dynamic GCN (Mlt-GCN), and a pseudolabel generation mechanism based on metric learning. The Siamese FCN contains a Siamese encoder and a pyramid-shaped decoder, aiming to extract multiscale features and integrate them to generate reliable difference images (DIs). Mlt-GCN focuses on capturing the short- and long-range contextual patterns at feature map level to extract changed and unchanged areas completely. The pseudolabel generation mechanism aims to produce reliable pseudolabels (changed, unchanged, and uncertain) to help accomplish the model training in an unsupervised way. Experiments on four HRRS image CD datasets demonstrate that GMCD outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 33, 'influentialCitationCount': 0, 'isOpenAccess': False, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'fieldsOfStudy': ['Computer Science'], 's2FieldsOfStudy': [{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}], 'publicationTypes': ['JournalArticle'], 'publicationDate': '2021-09-01', 'journal': {'volume': '60', 'pages': '1-15', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tang2021AnUR,\\n author = {Xu Tang and Huayu Zhang and Lichao Mou and Fang Liu and Xiangrong Zhang and Xiao Xiang Zhu and L.

The existing researches focus on improving the pixel representations by aggregating the contextual information within individual images. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the representations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input image. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training, to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN, PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements.

STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired labeled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module.

One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named TF-Blender, which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation models the relations between the current frame and its neigh-boring frames to preserve spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of every neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks. For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.

Recent methods used for change detection have shifted towards deep learning, which depends on the quality of its training data. The assembly of large-scale annotated satellite imagery datasets is therefore essential for global building-change surveillance. Existing datasets almost exclusively offer near-nadir viewing angles. This limits the range of changes that can be detected. By offering larger observation ranges, the scroll imaging mode of optical satellites presents an opportunity to overcome this restriction. This paper therefore introduces S2Looking, a building-change-detection dataset that contains large-scale side-looking satellite images captured at various off-nadir angles. The dataset consists of 5000 bitemporal image pairs of rural areas and more than 65,920 annotated instances of changes throughout the world. The dataset can be used to train deep-learning-based change-detection algorithms. It expands upon existing datasets by providing (1) larger viewing angles; (2) large illumination variances; and (3) the added complexity of rural images. To facilitate the use of the dataset, a benchmark task has been established, and preliminary tests suggest that deep-learning algorithms find the dataset significantly more challenging than the closest-competing near-nadir dataset, LEVIR-CD+.

To address the challenge that heterogeneous images cannot be directly compared due to different imaging mechanisms, we take advantage of the fact that the heterogeneous images share the same structure information for the same ground object, which is imaging modality-invariant. The proposed method first constructs a robust $K$ -nearest neighbor graph to represent the structure of each image, and then compares the graphs within the same image domain by means of graph mapping to calculate the forward and backward difference images, which can avoid the confusion of heterogeneous data. Finally, it detects the changes through a Markovian co-segmentation model that can fuse the forward and backward difference images in the segmentation process, which can be solved by the co-graph cut. Once the changed areas are detected by the Markovian co-segmentation, they will be propagated back into the graph construction process to reduce the influence of changed neighbors. This iterative framework makes the graph more robust and thus improves the final detection performance. Experimental results on different data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, high-resolution remote sensing CD remains challenging due to the complexity of objects in the scene. Objects with the same semantic concept may show distinct spectral characteristics at different times and spatial locations. Most recent CD pipelines using pure convolutions are still struggling to relate long-range concepts in space-time. Nonlocal self-attention approaches show promising performance via modeling dense relationships among pixels, yet are computationally inefficient. Here, we propose a bitemporal image transformer (BIT) to efficiently and effectively model contexts within the spatial-temporal domain. Our intuition is that the high-level concepts of the change of interest can be represented by a few visual words, that is, semantic tokens. To achieve this, we express the bitemporal image into a few tokens and use a transformer encoder to model contexts in the compact token-based space-time. The learned context-rich tokens are then fed back to the pixel-space for refining the original features via a transformer decoder. We incorporate BIT in a deep feature differencing-based CD framework. Extensive experiments on three CD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Notably, our BIT-based model significantly outperforms the purely convolutional baseline using only three times lower computational costs and model parameters. Based on a naive backbone (ResNet18) without sophisticated structures (e.g., feature pyramid network (FPN) and UNet), our model surpasses several state-of-the-art CD methods, including better than four recent attention-based methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

It is widely used in natural disaster monitoring and assessment, land resource planning, and other fields. As a pixel-to-pixel prediction task, change detection is sensitive about the utilization of the original position information. Recent change detection methods always focus on the extraction of deep change semantic feature, but ignore the importance of shallow-layer information containing high-resolution and fine-grained features, this often leads to the uncertainty of the pixels at the edge of the changed target and the determination miss of small targets. In this letter, we propose a densely connected siamese network for change detection, namely SNUNet-CD (the combination of Siamese network and NestedUNet). SNUNet-CD alleviates the loss of localization information in the deep layers of neural network through compact information transmission between encoder and decoder, and between decoder and decoder. In addition, Ensemble Channel Attention Module (ECAM) is proposed for deep supervision. Through ECAM, the most representative features of different semantic levels can be refined and used for the final classification.

In particular, we present a UNet-like architecture (L-UNet) that models the temporal relationship of spatial feature representations using integrated fully convolutional LSTM blocks on top of every encoding level. In this way, the network is able to capture the temporal relationship of spatial feature vectors in all encoding levels without the need to downsample or flatten them, forming an end-to-end trainable framework. Moreover, we further enrich the L-UNet architecture with an additional decoding branch that performs semantic segmentation on the available semantic categories that are presented in the different input dates, forming a multitask framework. Different loss quantities are also defined and combined together in a circular way to boost the overall performance. The developed methodology has been evaluated on three different data sets, i.e., the challenging bitemporal high-resolution Office National d’Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Sentinel-2 data set, the very high-resolution (VHR) multitemporal data set of the East Prefecture of Attica, Greece, and finally, the multitemporal VHR SpaceNet7 data set. Promising quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that the synergy among the tasks can boost up the achieved performances.

However, the existence of such temporal artifacts within deepfake videos is key in detecting and explaining deepfakes to a supervising human. To this end, we propose Dynamic Prototype Network (DPNet) – an interpretable and effective solution that utilizes dynamic representations (i.e., prototypes) to explain deepfake temporal artifacts. Extensive experimental results show that DPNet achieves competitive predictive performance, even on unseen testing datasets such as Google’s DeepFakeDetection, DeeperForensics, and Celeb-DF, while providing easy referential explanations of deepfake dynamics.

The intuitive way to solve the SSCD task is to fuse the extracted image feature pairs, and then directly measure the dissimilarity parts for producing a change map. Therefore, the key for the SSCD task is to design an effective feature fusion method that can improve the accuracy of the corresponding change maps. To this end, we present a novel Hierarchical Paired Channel Fusion Network (HPCFNet), which utilizes the adaptive fusion of paired feature channels. Specifically, the features of a given image pair are jointly extracted by a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) and hierarchically combined by exploring the fusion of channel pairs at multiple feature levels. In addition, based on the observation that the distribution of scene changes is diverse, we further propose a Multi-Part Feature Learning (MPFL) strategy to detect diverse changes. Based on the MPFL strategy, our framework achieves a novel approach to adapt to the scale and location diversities of the scene change regions.

In this work, we proposed a CorrFusion module that fuses the highly correlated components in bi-temporal feature embeddings. We first extract the deep representations of the bi-temporal inputs with deep convolutional networks. Then the extracted features will be projected into a lower-dimensional space to extract the most correlated components and compute the instance-level correlation. The cross-temporal fusion will be performed based on the computed correlation in CorrFusion module. The final scene classification results are obtained with softmax layers. In the objective function, we introduced a new formulation to calculate the temporal correlation more efficiently and stably. The detailed derivation of backpropagation gradients for the proposed module is also given. Besides, we presented a much larger scale scene change detection dataset with more semantic categories and conducted extensive experiments on this dataset.

However, general semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on scale variation in the natural scene, with inadequate consideration of the other two problems that usually happen in the large area earth observation scene. In this paper, we argue that the problems lie on the lack of foreground modeling and propose a foreground-aware relation network (FarSeg) from the perspectives of relation-based and optimization-based foreground modeling, to alleviate the above two problems. From perspective of relation, FarSeg enhances the discrimination of foreground features via foreground-correlated contexts associated by learning foreground-scene relation. Meanwhile, from perspective of optimization, a foreground-aware optimization is proposed to focus on foreground examples and hard examples of background during training for a balanced optimization.

Given two co-registered images taken at different times, the illumination variations and misregistration errors overwhelm the real object changes. Exploring the relationships among different spatial–temporal pixels may improve the performances of CD methods. In our work, we propose a novel Siamese-based spatial–temporal attention neural network. In contrast to previous methods that separately encode the bitemporal images without referring to any useful spatial–temporal dependency, we design a CD self-attention mechanism to model the spatial–temporal relationships. We integrate a new CD self-attention module in the procedure of feature extraction. Our self-attention module calculates the attention weights between any two pixels at different times and positions and uses them to generate more discriminative features. Considering that the object may have different scales, we partition the image into multi-scale subregions and introduce the self-attention in each subregion. In this way, we could capture spatial–temporal dependencies at various scales, thereby generating better representations to accommodate objects of various sizes. We also introduce a CD dataset LEVIR-CD, which is two orders of magnitude larger than other public datasets of this field. LEVIR-CD consists of a large set of bitemporal Google Earth images, with 637 image pairs (1024 × 1024) and over 31 k independently labeled change instances.

In this article, we propose a metric learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) (MeGAN) to automatically explore seasonal invariant features for pseudochange suppressing and real change detection. To achieve this purpose, a seasonal invariant term is introduced to maximally suppress pseudochanges, whereas the MeGAN explores the transition patterns between adjacent images in a self-learning fashion. Different from the previous works on bitemporal imagery change detection, the proposed MeGAN have the following contributions: 1) it automatically explores change patterns from the complex bitemporal background without human intervention and 2) it aims to maximally exclude pseudochanges from the seasonal transition term and map out real changes efficiently. To our best knowledge, this is the first time we incorporate the seasonal transition term and GAN for change detection between bitemporal images. At last, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, we included two data sets which are the Google Earth data and the Landsat data, for bitemporal change detection and evaluation.

We extend such approaches by considering an important orthogonal source of information: the network's confidence in its own predictions. We introduce probabilistic pixel-adaptive convolutions (PPACs), which not only depend on image guidance data for filtering, but also respect the reliability of per-pixel predictions. As such, PPACs allow for image-adaptive smoothing and simultaneously propagating pixels of high confidence into less reliable regions, while respecting object boundaries. We demonstrate their utility in refinement networks for optical flow and semantic segmentation, where PPACs lead to a clear reduction in boundary artifacts.

In this paper, we study predictive uncertainty estimation in FCNs for medical image segmentation. We make the following contributions: 1) We systematically compare cross-entropy loss with Dice loss in terms of segmentation quality and uncertainty estimation of FCNs; 2) We propose model ensembling for confidence calibration of the FCNs trained with batch normalization and Dice loss; 3) We assess the ability of calibrated FCNs to predict segmentation quality of structures and detect out-of-distribution test examples. We conduct extensive experiments across three medical image segmentation applications of the brain, the heart, and the prostate to evaluate our contributions.

Due to the great advantages in deep feature representation and nonlinear problem modeling, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular to solve CD tasks in remote-sensing community. However, most existing deep learning-based CD methods are implemented by either generating difference images using deep features or learning change relations between pixel patches, which leads to error accumulation problems since many intermediate processing steps are needed to obtain final change maps. To address the above-mentioned issues, a novel end-to-end CD method is proposed based on an effective encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation named UNet++, where change maps could be learned from scratch using available annotated datasets. Firstly, co-registered image pairs are concatenated as an input for the improved UNet++ network, where both global and fine-grained information can be utilized to generate feature maps with high spatial accuracy. Then, the fusion strategy of multiple side outputs is adopted to combine change maps from different semantic levels, thereby generating a final change map with high accuracy.

Thus, this study proposes a shape feature-based building change detection method. Specifically, a line-constrained shape (LCS) feature is developed to capture the shape characteristics of buildings. This feature improves the discriminability between buildings and other ground objects by integrating the pixel shape feature and line segments. The building candidate area (BCA) is created in accordance with the distribution of the line segments in two-phase images. The problem space is constrained in a high-likelihood region of buildings because of the BCA.

Among approaches to realize probabilistic inference in deep neural networks, variational Bayes (VB) is theoretically grounded, generally applicable, and computationally efficient. With wide recognition of potential advantages, why is it that variational Bayes has seen very limited practical use for BNNs in real applications? We argue that variational inference in neural networks is fragile: successful implementations require careful initialization and tuning of prior variances, as well as controlling the variance of Monte Carlo gradient estimates. We provide two innovations that aim to turn VB into a robust inference tool for Bayesian neural networks: first, we introduce a novel deterministic method to approximate moments in neural networks, eliminating gradient variance; second, we introduce a hierarchical prior for parameters and a novel Empirical Bayes procedure for automatically selecting prior variances.

We train a siamese convolutional network using the weighted contrastive loss. The novelty of the method is that the siamese network is learned to extract features directly from the image pairs. Compared with hand-crafted features used by the conventional change detection method, the extracted features are more abstract and robust. Furthermore, because of the advantage of the weighted contrastive loss function, the features have a unique property: the feature vectors of the changed pixel pair are far away from each other, while the ones of the unchanged pixel pair are close.

In practice, however, it is still difficult to select a suitable change‐detection method, especially in urban areas, because of the impacts of complex factors. This paper presents a new method using multitemporal and multisensor data (SPOT‐5 and Landsat data) to detect land‐use changes in an urban environment based on principal‐component analysis (PCA) and hybrid classification methods. After geometric correction and radiometric normalization, PCA was used to enhance the change information from stacked multisensor data. Then, a hybrid classifier combining unsupervised and supervised classification was performed to identify and quantify land‐use changes. Finally, stratified random and user‐defined plots sampling methods were synthetically used to obtain total 966 reference points for accuracy assessment. Although errors and confusion exist, this method shows satisfying results with an overall accuracy to be 89.54% and 0.88 for the kappa coefficient. When compared with the post‐classification method, PCA‐based change detection also showed a better accuracy in terms of overall, producer's, and user's accuracy and kappa index.

Unlike standard methods that are presented in the literature, the proposed approach can detect in a consistent and reliable way changes in images of large size also when the extension of the changed area is small (and, therefore, the prior probability of the class of changed pixels is very small). The method is based on the following: 1) a split of the large-size image into subimages; 2) an adaptive analysis of each subimage; and 3) an automatic split-based threshold-selection procedure. This general approach is used for defining a system for damage assessment in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed system has been developed to properly identify different levels of damages that are induced by tsunamis along coastal areas.

Such discrimination is usually performed by using empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, which affect both the accuracy and the reliability of the change-detection process. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, the authors propose two automatic techniques (based on the Bayes theory) for the analysis of the difference image. One allows an automatic selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the overall change detection error probability under the assumption that pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The other analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel. In particular, an approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) that exploits interpixel class dependency contexts is presented. Both proposed techniques require the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterize these distributions, they propose an iterative method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

However, locating changed objects with fine structural details is still a challenging problem in RSCD. In this article, we propose a novel RSCD network via temporal feature interaction and guided refinement (TFI-GR) to solve this issue. Specifically, unlike previous methods, which just employ one single concatenation or subtraction operation for bi-temporal feature fusion, we design a temporal feature interaction module (TFIM) to enhance interaction between bi-temporal features and capture temporal difference information at diverse feature levels. Afterward, a guided refinement modules (GRMs), which aggregates both low- and high-level temporal difference representations to polish the location information of high-level features and filter the background clutters of low-level features, is repeatedly performed. Finally, the multilevel temporal difference features are progressively fused to generate change maps for change detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TFI-GR, comprehensive experiments are performed on three high spatial resolution RSCD datasets.

Remote sensing change detection (CD) can provide an effective approach for in-time detection and prevention of such incidents. However, existing CD methods are difficult to deal with the large intraclass differences of cropland changes in high-resolution images. In addition, traditional CNN based models are plagued by the loss of long-range context information, and the high computational complexity brought by deep layers. Therefore, in this article, we propose a CNN-transformer network with multiscale context aggregation (MSCANet), which combines the merits of CNN and transformer to fulfill efficient and effective cropland CD. In the MSCANet, a CNN-based feature extractor is first utilized to capture hierarchical features, then a transformer-based MSCA is designed to encode and aggregate context information. Finally, a multibranch prediction head with three CNN classifiers is applied to obtain change maps, to enhance the supervision for deep layers. Besides, for the lack of CD dataset with fine-grained cropland change of interest, we also provide a new cropland change detection dataset, which contains 600 pairs of 512 × 512 bi-temporal images with the spatial resolution of 0.5–2m.

The selective kernel convolution (SKConv) is first embedded into the encoders of the Siamese network to improve its feature extraction ability.

Unfortunately, most of existing models do not consider the issue. In this study, uncertainty is estimated and reduced to build a trustworthy HSI classifier. Firstly, since the output probabilities of softmax layer cannot represent the confidence scores, distance measurement scheme is used to measure the confidence scores. And then, a trustworthy HSI classifier, which reduces the predictive uncertainty in CNN (i.e., PU-CNN), is obtained by minimizing the distance to the correct centroid. Secondly, the fact that a training sample of HSI usually contains many pixel vectors that belong to different classes, which brings label uncertainty. Then, label uncertainty CNN (i.e., LU-CNN), which uses a classifier-consistent estimator to recover the multiple classes in each HSI sample, is proposed. LU-CNN computes loss over candidate label sets to find the optimal classes, which leads to a trustworthy HSI classifier. Finally, the combination of PU-CNN and LU-CNN (i.e., PL-CNN) is proposed to address predictive uncertainty and label uncertainty at the same time. Experimental results on the three popular hyperspectral datasets show that the proposed methods yield improvements in both accuracy and confidence. The proposed trustworthy classifier opens a new window for safe usage of HSI.', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1, 'influentialCitationCount': 0, 'isOpenAccess': False, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'fieldsOfStudy': ['Computer Science'], 's2FieldsOfStudy': [{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}], 'publicationTypes': ['JournalArticle'], 'publicationDate': None, 'journal': {'volume': 'PP', 'pages': '1-1', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{He2022TowardsAT,\\n author = {Xin He and Yushi Chen and Lin Huang},\\n booktitle = {IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing},\\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing},\\n pages = {1-1},\\n title = {Towards a Trustworthy Classifier with Deep CNN: Uncertainty Estimation Meets Hyperspectral Image},\\n volume = {PP},\\n year = {2022}\\n}\\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2154166122', 'name': 'Xin He'}, {'authorId': '2597809', 'name': 'Yushi Chen'}, {'authorId': '2111398941', 'name': 'Lin Huang'}]}, {'paperId': '753606373f25a508771edca33a9a8d37c128d27f', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': 'journals/tgrs/SunLGLK22', 'DOI': '10.1109/TGRS.2021.3110998', 'CorpusId': 239322612}, 'corpusId': 239322612, 'publicationVenue': {'id': '70628d6a-97aa-4571-9701-bc0eb3989c32', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'type': 'journal', 'alternate_names': ['IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens'], 'issn': '0196-2892', 'url': 'http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=36', 'alternate_urls': ['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=36']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/753606373f25a508771edca33a9a8d37c128d27f', 'title': 'Sparse-Constrained Adaptive Structure Consistency-Based Unsupervised Image Regression for Heterogeneous Remote- Sensing Change Detection', 'abstract': 'Change detection of heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is an important and challenging topic in remote sensing. Since the imaging mechanisms of heterogeneous sensors are different, it is not possible to directly compare heterogeneous images to detect changes as in the homogeneous images. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised image regression-based change detection method based on the structure consistency. The proposed method first adaptively constructs a similarity graph to represent the structure of a pre-event image, then uses the graph to translate the pre-event image to the domain of the post-event image, and then computes the difference image. Finally, a superpixel-based Markovian segmentation model is designed to segment the difference image into changed and unchanged classes. The proposed adaptive structure consistency-based image regression model can not only alleviate the impact of noise and changed pixels on the regression process by using the structure-based transformation, but also easily distinguish between changed and unchanged classes in the difference image by using the prior sparse knowledge of changes. Experimental results on six different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with some state-of-the-art methods.', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 18, 'influentialCitationCount': 0, 'isOpenAccess': False, 'openAccessPdf': None, 'fieldsOfStudy': ['Computer Science'], 's2FieldsOfStudy': [{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}], 'publicationTypes': ['JournalArticle'], 'publicationDate': None, 'journal': {'volume': 'PP', 'pages': '1-14', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2021SparseConstrainedAS,\\n author = {Yuli Sun and Lin Lei and Dongdong Guan and Ming Li and Gangyao Kuang},\\n booktitle = {IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing},\\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing},\\n pages = {1-14},\\n title = {Sparse-Constrained Adaptive Structure Consistency-Based Unsupervised Image Regression for Heterogeneous Remote- Sensing Change Detection},\\n volume = {PP},\\n year = {2021}\\n}\\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1500378392', 'name': 'Yuli Sun'}, {'authorId': '35975070', 'name': 'Lin Lei'}, {'authorId': '50420536', 'name': 'Dongdong Guan'}, {'authorId': '2150653803', 'name': 'Ming Li'}, {'authorId': '7897173', 'name': 'Gangyao Kuang'}]}, {'paperId': 'e78359fb85f5fc0749ac02237d49c08a59e54923', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': 'journals/tgrs/LeiWNWX0N22', 'DOI': '10.1109/tgrs.2021.3134691', 'CorpusId': 245084977}, 'corpusId': 245084977, 'publicationVenue': {'id': '70628d6a-97aa-4571-9701-bc0eb3989c32', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'type': 'journal', 'alternate_names': ['IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens'], 'issn': '0196-2892', 'url': 'http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=36', 'alternate_urls': ['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=36']}, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e78359fb85f5fc0749ac02237d49c08a59e54923', 'title': 'Difference Enhancement and Spatial-Spectral Non-Local Network for Change Detection in VHR Remote Sensing Images', 'abstract': 'The popular Siamese convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for remote sensing (RS) image change detection (CD) often suffer from two problems. First, they either ignore the original information of bi-temporal images or insufficiently utilize the difference information between bi-temporal images, which leads to the low tightness of the changed objects. Secondly, Siamese CNNs always employ dual-branch encoder for CD, which increases computational cost. To address above issues, this paper proposes a network based on difference enhancement and spatial-spectral non-local (DESSN) for CD in very-high-resolution (VHR) images. This paper makes threefold contributions. First, we design a difference enhancement (DE) module that can effectively learn the difference representation between foreground and background to reduce the impact of irrelevant changes on the detection results. Second, we present a spatial-spectral non-local (SSN) module that is different from vanilla non-local, because multi-scale spatial global features are incorporated to model the large-scale variation of objects during CD. The module can be used to strengthen the edge integrity and internal tightness of changed objects. Third, the asymmetric double convolution with Ghost (ADCG) module is exploited instead of standard convolution. The ADCG can not only refine the edge information of the changed objects since horizontal and vertical convolutional kernels have good contour preservation advantages, but also greatly reduce the computational complexity of the proposed model. The experiments on two public VHR CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed network can provide higher detection accuracy and requires smaller memory usage than state-of-the-art networks.', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 21, 'influentialCitationCount': 2, 'isOpenAccess': True, 'openAccessPdf': {'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/36/9633014/09646959.pdf', 'status': None}, 'fieldsOfStudy': ['Computer Science'], 's2FieldsOfStudy': [{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}], 'publicationTypes': ['JournalArticle'], 'publicationDate': None, 'journal': {'volume': 'PP', 'pages': '1-1', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lei2021DifferenceEA,\\n author = {Tao Lei and Jie Wang and Hailong Ning and Xingwu Wang and Dinghua Xue and Qi Wang and A.

Monitoring techniques based on multispectral satellite‐acquired data have demonstrated potential as a means to detect, identify, and map changes in forest cover. This paper, which reviews the methods and the results of digital change detection primarily in temperate forest ecosystems, has two major components. First, the different perspectives from which the variability in the change event has been approached are summarized, and the appropriate choice of digital imagery acquisition dates and interval length for change detection are discussed. In the second part, preprocessing routines to establish a more direct linkage between digital remote sensing data and biophysical phenomena, and the actual change detection methods themselves are reviewed and critically assessed.
